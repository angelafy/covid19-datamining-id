# üìä COVID-19 Data Mining: Clustering & Classification

This project analyzes COVID-19 data in Indonesia from 2022 using **K-Means Clustering** and **Logistic Regression**.  
The goal is to cluster provinces based on total cases and deaths, and to classify the risk level (**Low**, **Medium**, **High**) using logistic regression.

Built using **Python** and **Streamlit**, the app provides an interactive dashboard with several key features.

## üöÄ Features

- üìå **Elbow Method Visualization** to determine the optimal number of clusters  
- üìä **K-Means Clustering** results visualized with scatter plots and tabular outputs  
- üß† **Classification Model** using Logistic Regression with evaluation metrics:
  - Accuracy
  - Precision
  - Recall
  - F1-Score
- ‚öôÔ∏è **Data Preprocessing**:
  - Normalization using StandardScaler  
  - Categorical encoding using LabelEncoder  
  - Imbalanced class handling with **SMOTE**
- üîé **Filtering Tools**:
  - Filter data by province name (case-insensitive search)
  - Display filtered clustering results
